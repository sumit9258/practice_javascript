<article><h3> Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. was founded on 16 December 2013 by former Oppo vice-president Pete Lau and Carl Pei.[8] According to Chinese public records, OnePlus'</h3> only institutional Investor is Oppo Electronics.[4] Lau denied that OnePlus was a Subsidiary of Oppo and stated that Oppo Electronics and not Oppo Mobile (the phone manufacturer) is a major investor of OnePlus. Lau went on to state that they were "in talks with other investors",[9] although OnePlus has confirmed it uses Oppo's manufacturing line and shares part of the supply chain resources with Oppo.[1</article>

<section>Well, it is their strategy to sell it with least marketing Costs to keep the price down, it would honestly beat the purpose if they would go for heavy marketing, moreover it is a phone for a geek to be honest, to enjoy it, you need to know

<tfoot>OP should probably get its operations under control right now, first. They are having production issues and shipment issues at this moment. In time, maybe they can #hype in India. Right now they have #overhyped and #underdelivered everywhere.</tfoot>
